To make the code work, there must be a folder in current path named 'lib' which contains all the .jar files for this test. 

To compile the code, run: 
javac -Djava.ext.dirs=lib curatorTest.java

After this, to run the test, run like this:
java -Djava.ext.dirs=lib curatorTest 200 16000 6000 30000 0
Argument 200 means rate is recorded every 200 ms.
Argument 16000 and 6000 means that when the number of unfinished requests below 6000, another bunch of requests are submitted such that total number of unfinished requests goes back to 16000.
Argument 30000 means each test would run for 30 seconds.
Argument 0 means test would submit asynchronous requests, 1 is for synchronous requests.
