1) Download sshguard 1.5 from http://www.sshguard.net
	- Apply sshguard.patch
	- Rebuild 'configure' by doing 'configure --with-firewall=null && make configure'
	- Build with 'configure --with-firewall=dnp && make'
2) Copy included fw-cmd-*.sh to /tmp/dnp-fw/
3) Launch DNP server: './dnp -s 4242'
4) Install initial environment: 'nc localhost 4242 < fw-setup-basic.dnpi'
5) Run sshguard: 'src/sshguard -l -'
	- This will read STDIN as a syslog as described here:
		http://www.sshguard.net/docs/setup/getlogs/log-sucker/
	- Typing attack signatures as shown here:
		http://www.sshguard.net/docs/reference/attack-signatures/
		For example:
Jan 9 10:31:00 localhost sshd[2000]: Invalid user BadGuy from 10.0.0.201
Jan 9 10:31:00 localhost sshd[2000]: Invalid user BadGuy from 10.0.0.201
Jan 9 10:31:00 localhost sshd[2000]: Invalid user BadGuy from 10.0.0.201
Jan 9 10:31:00 localhost sshd[2000]: Invalid user BadGuy from 10.0.0.201

You should now see new deny rules in the DNP server window!
