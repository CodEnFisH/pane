Root says NewNetwork PublicNetwork <: RootNetwork.
Root says NewNetwork PrivateNetwork <: RootNetwork.
Root says allow() on PublicNetwork. // allow everything
Root says deny() on PrivateNetwork. // deny everything
Root says allow(user=Arjun) on PrivateNetwork. // allow Arjun's flows

/*
Ok, how do we allow Arjun to create new users only on PublicNetwork ?  

Root says mask Arjun NewUser <: Arjun on PublicNetwork.

maybe? Users are created on networks seems to make sense.

Or, we could say that Arjun can create users below him, BUT what we are really trying to do is keep that new user from inheriting Arjun's permissions on PrivateNetwork. So that is a new type of mask which we have not discussed...
